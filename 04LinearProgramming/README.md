# Linear Programming

#### Smallest Enclosed Discs

##### Installing
You need to have `g++` and recommended run it on Linux machine. Change to the right directory and run the following command
```
g++ smallest_enclosing_discs.cpp && ./a.out <number of points>
```

example:
```
g++ smallest_enclosing_discs.cpp && ./a.out 10
```

_Focus on the algorithm, rather then how to compile._

##### Remark
I did not invest time in graphic drawing, feel free to constribute :). Alternative, I make the program output in a format that will be easier to plug into [Graphing Calculator - Desmos](https://www.desmos.com/calculator).
