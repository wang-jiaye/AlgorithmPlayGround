# CMPT463 Advanced Algorithms
This repository contains my assignment solutions and project of this course. This course is mostly focused on computational geometry, check the topics down below. The textbook is [Computational Geometry: Algorithms and Applications](https://www.amazon.ca/Computational-Geometry-Applications-Mark-Berg/dp/3540779736/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=computational+geometry&qid=1630988883&sr=8-1). Since this is a very advanced couse, I also enrolled in [计算几何 | Computational Geometry](https://www.edx.org/course/computational-geometry) (Chinese with English subtitles) offered by Tsinghua University on edX. 

### Main Topics
- Convex Hulls
- Line Segment Intersection
- Triangulations
- Linear Programming
- Orthogonal Range Searching
- Voronoi Diagrams
- Arrangements and Duality
- Delaunay Triangulations
- Geometric Data Structures
