# Linear Programming

#### Smallest Enclosed Discs

##### Installing
You need to have `g++` and recommended run it on Linux maxhine. Change to the right directory and run the following command
```
make
```

##### Running
```
./smallest_enclosing_discs <number of points>
```
example:
```
./smallest_enclosing_discs 10
```

##### Remark
I did not invest time in graphic drawing, feel free to constribute :). Alternative, I make the program output in a format that will be easier to plug into [Graphing Calculator - Desmos](https://www.desmos.com/calculator).
